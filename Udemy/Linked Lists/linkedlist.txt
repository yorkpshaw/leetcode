Linked lists, unlike arrays, do not have indices.

They contain a head, tail, and length property.
Linked lists consist of nodes
Each node has a value and a "next" pointer to another node, or null if it is at the end
Random access is not allowed (But they are in arrays)

The head is the beginning and the tail is the end.

Linked lists are like a skyscraper with no elevators, but only stairs.

Head                 Tail
[4] -> [6] -> [8] -> [2] ->
   next   next   next   null

Length:4

Linked lists are good for insertion and deletion(push/pop), because everything has to be re-indexed in an array
